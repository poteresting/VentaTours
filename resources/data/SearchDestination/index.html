    <h3>About Ventspils City</h3>
    <p>Ventspils is a city in northwestern Latvia in the historical Courland region of Latvia, and is the <strong>sixth
        largest city</strong> in the country. At the beginning of 2020, Ventspils had a population of
      <u>33,906</u>.<br>It is situated on the Venta River and the Baltic Sea, and has an ice-free port. The city's name
      literally means <em>"castle on the Venta"</em>, referring to the Livonian Order's castle built alongside the Venta
      River.

    <h4>1. Ventspils Beach</h4>
    <p>For Ventspils, the wide stretch of dazzling white sand south of the Venta River is its main treasure. During the
      warmer months, beach bums of every ilk â€“ from nudists to kiteboarders â€“ line the pristine Blue Flag sands to
      absorb the sunâ€™s rays. It's backed by a belt of dunes and a lush manicured park.</p>

    <h4>2. Livonian Order Castle</h4>
    <p>This blocky building doesn't look obviously castle-like from the outside, but the 13th-century interior is home
      to an entertaining interactive local history and art museum. During Soviet rule the castle was used as a prison,
      and an exhibit in the stables recounts its horrors.</p>
